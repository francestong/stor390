# **Hello Shiny!**

Running the code below in the R console will start up a simple Shiny app that
plots a histogram and lets the user choose the number of bins in the histogram 
using a slider.  The code that powers the app is included, and relevant parts 
of the code will be highlighted yellow as you interact with the app.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require('shiny')) install.packages("shiny")
shiny::runGitHub("shiny-examples", "rstudio", subdir = "001-hello")
```
