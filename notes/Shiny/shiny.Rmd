You can make interactive web applications easily and entirely in R with Shiny.
Shiny apps are a great way to share your analysis with others without them having to 
run any R themselves.


This lecture will cover (**list in progress**)

- first Shiny app
- beer to burpees app
- the basics of reactivity
- renderUI
- advanced: 
    - file uploading & downloading
    - pdf/html/word generation
    - database connection
    - modules

# **Hello Shiny!**

Running the code below in the R console will start up a simple Shiny app that
plots a histogram and lets the user choose the number of bins in the histogram 
using a slider.  The code that powers the app is included, and relevant parts 
of the code will be highlighted yellow as you interact with the app.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require('shiny')) install.packages("shiny")
runExample("01_hello")
```

# **Key components of a Shiny app**

A Shiny app is composed of two fundamental parts:

- **ui** - This codes the __user interface__ that controls the layout and appearance of the app.
- **server** - This codes the computations and plots that show up in the user interface.

## File structure

These two parts can either be included in one file called **app.R** or 
in two separate files called **ui.R** and **server.R**.  Both methods work
equivalently, and it's a matter of preference which one you choose and may 
depend on if your app is very short or long.

This is the bare minimum code (it does nothing - a blank page shows up) 
if the app is on one **app.R** file:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
ui <- fluidPage()
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

And as you may suspect already, for two separate files, **ui.R** will contain

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
ui <- fluidPage()
```

and **server.R** has

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
server <- function(input, output) {}
```

If the two files are stored in a directory called `my_app`, then you can run the
app with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
runApp("my_app")
```

Extra: if you want your code to show up alongside your app like in the example, 
then change the display mode to `showcase`.

```{r}
runApp("my_app", display.mode = "showcase")
```
